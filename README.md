# School_District_Analysis - Challenge
## Introduction

#### The purpose of this analysis project is to assist administrators and the school board identify anomalies within the test scores of the ninth graders at Thomas High School.  This will assist the school board in uphold the standards of state testing.

## Approach
#### In determining the best approach to fulfill this request, I started by replacing the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School with null values (NaN). All other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School was kept intact and then I repeated the analysis to determine the effect of removing these grades has on the overall performance of the school.


## Effects on District and School Summary Tables


#### When the 9th grade student Math and Reading scores were excluded from analysis, there was a slight decrease to the average scores in each column of the summary table.  Comparing the two charts above the average show the difference when the 9th grade student Math and Reading scores from Thomas High Schools were excluded from the District Summary. Excluding the Thomas High Schools 9th grade students Reading and Math scores slightly affected by tenths of average scores in Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing. The overall slight decrease in averages do not change but it will affect the following summaries. So, under the district summary Thomas High School performed slightly lower compared to the previous analysis which included the 9th Grade Student scores.  In reading, Thomas percent passed was 97.0%, for math, 93.2% and overall, it was 90.6%.  This is slightly lower than the original scores of 97.2 for reading, 93.3 for math, and 90.9 overall. 

## Effects on Deeper Analysis

#### When recalculating the scores by grade, school spending, school size, and school type there were some changings worth noting.

#### For Scores by Grade, 9th grade scores there were little changes of note. 
#### For scores by school spending, under the spending range $638-644, the percentages for passing reading, math and overall went up to 75.7%, 86.1%, 66.1% respectively from 73.5%, 84.4%, and 62.9%.
#### For scores by school size, in medium based schools the scores for math 93.60%, reading 96.8, and overall, 90.6% decreased to math 93.58%, reading 96.7% and overall, 90.55%. 
#### Lastly, for charter schools under “School Type” the scores decreased slightly from math 93.62% reading 96.58%, overall, 90.43% to math 93.61% reading 96.55% and overall, 90.39%.

## Conclusion 

#### In summary there were small changes that occurred when excluding the Thomas Highschool 9th math and reading scores from the overall reported overall school district reported scores.  This information should be interpreted by administration as a slight change that may be inconsequential in determining the extent of academic dishonesty district wide.
